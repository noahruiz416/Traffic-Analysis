**Data Methods:**

For this project data was sourced from the City of Tempe Traffic Bureu. Included in this project is a file of the data that was worked with throughout this project. 
Regarding file size the data is around 17 MB and contains over 39,000 total rows. During the EDA process a substantial amount of errors were found in the dataset,
which we belive is due to data entry errors. The total amount of records that were misentered is around 4000, though we do not excepct it to change our results too much.
Regarding the dataset there are about 34 different fields, which gives us a substantial amount of variables to work with.
